# Chisel Rendering Engine
Chisel is a OpenGL based rendering engine. It is an on going play project made by yours truly.<br>
As said, this is a play project, which there for implies that I just on and off it a whole lot. Come back at a later date just to add some features.

Added ambient light, as well as some UI elements. The user can simply edit the color of the directional light now. As well as strength and ambient strength. You even get feedback relating to texture duplications that have been avoided! <br>
I've started working on pointlights, and I've setup a small ImGui menu tab for them. But I still have to apply some functionality.

I'm going to fix a small issue with camera snapping when going in and out of free roam.<br>
I shall also delve into a basic list over techniques that I would want to see implemented <br>
I shall setup a basic layout to support vertex pulling.<br>
I will also have to consider displaying statistics to the screen(fps, memory, duplicated texture count)
