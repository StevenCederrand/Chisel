# Chisel Rendering Engine
Chisel is a OpenGL based rendering engine. It is an on going play project made by yours truly.<br>
As said, this is a play project, which there for implies that I just on and off it a whole lot. Come back at a later date just to add some features.

I'm going to fix a small issue with camera snapping when going in and out of free roam.<br>
I shall also delve into a basic list over techniques that I would want to see implemented <br>
I shall setup a basic layout to support vertex pulling.<br>
I will also have to consider displaying statistics to the screen(fps, memory, duplicated texture count)
